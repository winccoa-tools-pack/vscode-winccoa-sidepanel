# WinCC OA VS Code Extension Template

Minimal starter template for creating VS Code extensions for WinCC OA with Git Flow workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Initial Setup

1. **Create repository from this template**

   ```bash
   # Via GitHub CLI
   gh repo create winccoa-tools-pack/<your-extension-name> \
     --template winccoa-tools-pack/template-vscode-extension \
     --public
   ```

2. **Clone and initialize Git Flow**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/winccoa-tools-pack/<your-extension-name>
   cd <your-extension-name>
   
   # Run the setup script (PowerShell)
   .\setup-gitflow.ps1
   
   # Or manually
   git flow init -d
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and build**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run compile
   npm test
   ```

## 🌳 Git Flow Workflow

This template uses [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for branch management:

### Branch Structure

- **`main`** - Production-ready code (stable releases)
- **`develop`** - Integration branch (pre-release features)
- **`feature/*`** - New features
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation
- **`hotfix/*`** - Emergency fixes for production

### Common Commands

```bash
# Start a new feature
git flow feature start my-feature

# Finish feature (merges to develop)
git flow feature finish my-feature

# Start a release
git flow release start 1.0.0

# Finish release (merges to main and develop, creates tag)
git flow release finish 1.0.0

# Hotfix for production
git flow hotfix start 1.0.1
git flow hotfix finish 1.0.1
```

### Branch Protection

The `setup-gitflow.ps1` script applies protection rules:

- **main**: Requires PR reviews, status checks, no force pushes
- **develop**: Requires PR reviews, status checks, allows force pushes (for rebasing)

## 🔐 VS Code Marketplace Publishing Setup

To enable automatic publishing to the VS Code Marketplace when creating releases, you need to configure a Personal Access Token:

### Why VSCE_PAT is Required

The `release.yml` workflow automatically publishes your extension to the VS Code Marketplace when you merge a release PR to `main`. This requires authentication with Azure DevOps.

### How to Get a Personal Access Token

1. **Go to Azure DevOps**
   - Navigate to: <https://dev.azure.com>

2. **Create Personal Access Token**
   - Click on your profile → **Personal access tokens**
   - Click **+ New Token**
   - Name: `VS Code Marketplace Publishing`
   - Organization: **All accessible organizations**
   - Expiration: Choose appropriate duration
   - Scopes: **Marketplace** → **Manage** (check the box)
   - Click **Create**
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

3. **Add Token to Repository**
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - Name: `VSCE_PAT`
   - Value: Paste your Personal Access Token
   - Click **"Add secret"**

### Publisher Setup

You also need a publisher account on the VS Code Marketplace:

1. **Create Publisher**
   - Go to <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage>
   - Click **Create publisher**
   - Fill in publisher details (ID, name, etc.)
   - Your publisher ID should match the `publisher` field in `package.json`

2. **Update package.json**

   ```json
   {
     "publisher": "your-publisher-id",
     "name": "your-extension-name"
   }
   ```

### Testing Without VSCE_PAT

If `VSCE_PAT` is not configured, the workflow will:

- ✅ Still run tests and build the extension
- ✅ Create GitHub releases with VSIX files
- ⚠️ Skip Marketplace publishing with a warning message

You can always publish manually later:

```bash
vsce publish
```

## 📦 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Watch mode (auto-compile on changes)
npm run watch

# Run tests
npm test

# Package extension (.vsix file)
npm run package

# Run lint
npm run lint
```

## 🎯 Testing Your Extension

Press `F5` in VS Code to open a new Extension Development Host window with your extension loaded.
